tclzwave
========

this is a set of tcl bindings for open zwave

notes
========
note if you are using the aeon labs zstick 2 on mac OSX make sure you
have the latest driver. i got the one from the aeon labs site and it's old
and does not work on the latest osx

Try the driver from this site: 
    http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx 

to get the latest 64 bit Lion drivers for OS/X.

once the driver is installed you should see the device.

    /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART

This is the device to use in conjunction w/ openzwave.
